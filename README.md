# ANSI-C Workspace

This repository is my own learning and working through the material and exercises in the book "The C Programming Language, Second Edition" by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie. ISBN-10: 0-13-110362-8.
_I claim no rights whatsoever concerning this publication. It's a great book. Go buy a copy!_

I am using the ANSI-C (C89) standard with Clang compiler version 12.0.0 on Windows 10 64-bit.

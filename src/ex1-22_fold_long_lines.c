/* Exercise 1-22:
 *   Write a program to "fold" long input lines into two or 
 *   more shorter lines after the last non-blank character 
 *   that occurs before the n-th column of input. Make sure 
 *   your program does something intelligent with very long 
 *   lines, and if there are no blanks or tabs before the 
 *   specified column.
